# Grizzly

**Grizzly** is a web application designed to make random decisions in a fun and interactive way. Inspired by the *CS\:GO* case opening animation, Grizzly allows users to define their own items (text or images) and watch as one is selected through a side-scrolling animation.

Perfect for moments when making a choice should be as fun as the outcome.
