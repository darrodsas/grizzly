# Grizzly

**Grizzly** is a web application designed to make random decisions in a fun and interactive way. Inspired by the *CS\:GO* case opening animation, Grizzly allows users to define their own items (text or images) and watch as one is selected through a side-scrolling animation.

Perfect for moments when making a choice should be as fun as the outcome.

* Fully customizable: add your own text or image items.
* Fast, clean, and responsive interface.
* Frontend only: built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies

* **React** ‚Äì Modern UI framework.
* **TypeScript** ‚Äì Static typing for improved reliability.
* **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äì Utility-first CSS framework for flexible design.
* **Bum** - JavaScript runtime enviroment and package manager.
